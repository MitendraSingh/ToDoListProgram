# ToDoListProgram

Problem: Write a JAVA standalone TODO (TODO is a textual input whose length may vary from 3 characters to 30 characters String) program, where user should be able to carry out following operations.

1. Able to insert a TODO task
2. Able to update a TODO task
3. Able to delete a TODO task
4. Able to list all the TODO task

You can use a file for persisting the TODO task data.

You can assume that the program will not store more than 100 TODO tasks.

State any assumptions you make clearly.

Program should be able to take command line arguments for performing above listed operations and should persist the data between independent executions.
